		//Arrays:
		//1. Work really well if we can use them - great in certain situations
		//2. Are NOT dynamic - the size cannot change
			int myNumbersArray[] = new int[10];
			// 10 = size. We cannot change that later on
		// THE ANSWER IS COLLECTIONS
			
		// ArrayList - array using collections with definition by index
			// FAST when adding at the END of the list
		// LinkedList - array list with definition by proximity
			// FAST when adding throughout or in the middle of the list
		// Map - key-value pairs. map(key,value) where key is any value (integer, String, or anything)
		// Set - similar to Lists, but do not contain duplicates. Only contains unique values
